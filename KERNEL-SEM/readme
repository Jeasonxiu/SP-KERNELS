A playground for Karen's kernel idea.
Step (1) Generate synthetics for a scatterer that moves in depth.
Step (2) Deconvolve synthetics.
Step (3) Use symmetries to make a 2-D scattering kernel (red for positive RF amp, blue for negative RF amp)

Things to fix now, but adjust later:
(1) Ray parameter (angle of incident wave)
(2) Dominant period of incidence plane wave
(3) 1-D background model?  (start with simple halfspace, no moho)
(4) Deconvolution params
